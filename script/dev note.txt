	The *net.IPAddr type is much rarer in that specific context; it usually appears when you are doing things like DNS lookups or specific low-level socket work.
	case *net.IPAddr:
		// IPAddr doesn't have a Mask, so we can't return it as a *net.IPNet
		// If you need a *net.IPNet, you'd have to create one manually:
		if v.IP.To4() != nil {
			return &net.IPNet{IP: v.IP, Mask: net.CIDRMask(32, 32)}, nil
		}
